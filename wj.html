		<div class="intro-body">
		<p>The prices of the houses, which are near top primary schools and middle schools, are skyrocketing high in Beijing. A more extreme example is that 11 square meters of the house in Wenchang Hutong in downtown Beijing which is near the best primary school—Beijing No.2 Experimental Primary School, was sold by 460000 yuan (equal to about 73000 dollars) per square meters. It seems that most parents in Beijing are willing to buy wildly expensive houses to send their children to the best schools, though the prices of these houses might be too high to afford. </p>
        <br><br>
		<p>In China, the ‘nearby enrollment’ policy which means that schools to admit children who live locally, especially those whose ‘Houkou’ is in the area and whose family own a property nearby, is the basic admission policy of public schools in the compulsory education system. Chinese families put enormous emphasis on education and they are willing to change the locations of houses for better education. Many parents believe that choosing a right primary school for their children is essential for them to have good high school education followed by a prestigious university. In addition, the distribution of good educational resources is imbalanced, mainly distributed in four administrative districts, Xicheng, Dongcheng, Haidian and Chaoyang.

Distance to the closest primary school does not make much effects on housing prices because the children of the household could be enrolled to the primary school as long as he or she lives within the enrolment range of the primary school.
But the quality of primary schools make huge difference! Since the enrolment of primary schools obeys the “nearby enrolment” rule, the residential location of a household will have strong connection with the primary school nearby, which means children will be enrolled in this primary school when their age are eligible. Parents usually expect their children to study in a high quality primary school. Thus, parents will tend to choose their residence near high quality primary schools. Thus, primary schools of higher quality could significantly increase the housing prices nearby.
Some primary schools might have transition approaches to middle schools. If the corresponding middle schools of these primary schools are of high quality, it would be considered that they might still be attractive to parents. However, data show us that the quality of these corresponding middle schools does not have much effects on housing prices.

	 <a>epilogue</a>
	 <p>
The results could be concluded into three parts: school density factors, primary school factors and middle school factors.
 First, the density of both non-general primary and middle schools could positively affect housing prices.
 Next, quality of closest primary schools could make a difference on housing prices because of the nearby enrolment policy, whereas the distance from the house to the closest primary schools does not.
 Then, effects of three kinds of middle schools are discussed. For the best schools within school districts, their quality have significant effects on housing prices in Xicheng and Chaoyang, while housing prices in Dongcheng and Chaoyang are not affected. Distance to these schools does not have any effects on housing prices. For the best schools within administrative districts, higher quality of the top school of an administrative district would increase the housing prices in that district. And the distance from residence to these top schools has huge effects on housing prices in all four administrative districts. For the middle school closest to a house, neither the quality of school nor the distance between the school and the house would affect housing prices.
