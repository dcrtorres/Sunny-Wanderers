		    <p>In China, the ‘nearby enrollment’ policy which means that schools to admit children who live locally, especially those whose ‘Houkou’ is in the area and whose family own a property nearby, is the basic admission policy of public schools in the compulsory education system. Chinese families put enormous emphasis on education and they are willing to change the locations of houses for better education. Many parents believe that choosing a right primary school for their children is essential for them to have good high school education followed by a prestigious university. In addition, the distribution of good educational resources is imbalanced, mainly distributed in four administrative districts, Xicheng, Dongcheng, Haidian and Chaoyang.

		    <p>The prices of the houses, which are near top primary schools and middle schools, are skyrocketing high in Beijing. A more extreme example is that 11 square meters of the house in Wenchang Hutong in downtown Beijing which is near the best primary school—Beijing No.2 Experimental Primary School, was sold by 460000 yuan (equal to about 73000 dollars) per square meters. It seems that most parents in Beijing are willing to buy wildly expensive houses to send their children to the best schools, though the prices of these houses might be too high to afford. </p>
